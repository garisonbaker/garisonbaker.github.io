				<td><p> Founded in 1898 by Ossian Everett Mills, Phi Mu Alpha is the world's oldest and largest fraternal society in music. Since it's founding in 1950, UGA's Epsilon Lamda
						chapter of <abbr title="Phi Mu Alpha">PMA</abbr> has spread the ideals of Phi Mu Alpha here in Athens. The Epsilon Lambda Chapter seeks to further the Ossian Everett Mills Music Mission in Athens by routinely visiting places in the community to sing and share music. We seek to
						spread music and fellowship to the community in order to help further advance music in America in accordance to our noble object. Pictured here are me and the rest of my brothers from the pledge class of 2016.</p></td>
